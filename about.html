			<h1>MY LOML >_< </h1>
			<p> I met this girl in a mobile game, I didn't expect that we'll ended up being together. While we're playing we're also starting to get to know each other and we're getting along to each other. We do accepet each others flaw and because of that we manage to go this far. We've met a several times and that was the best meet ups that I've ever had and she always make me feel alive and happy.By just playing a game I met someone I want to be with, and we're still together right now and happy.I'm the happiest when I'm with her and I don't regret being with her and all the things we've been through together made us strong. In thousand year I will still choose her and will still look for her. Meet my girl, she's leila and she's the one I want to be with in the future.She's my first ever Girlfriend so I will make sure to give everything to her so I will not regret anything and I'll keep making her feel special in every moment. I will be the one who'll stay in her side until we're old and gray. </p>

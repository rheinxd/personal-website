	<h1>My background</h1>
	<p>A little glimpse of my background and what I've been through to get here.</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="course-col">
		<h3>Little backstory</h3>
		<p>I honestly have no idea how old I am when my familiy get seperated and I also have no idea why things ended up that way. I was elementary student when I feel something is off in our house because I couldn't bring myself liking the atmosphere of our home that time. Things happened so quickly and it was hard to process that momment because I couldn't believe at that situation at first.</p>
		
		<div class="course-col">
		<h3> Highschool Life</h3>
		<p>Highschool is not hard as I thought or I'm just being good at acads? Not really sure about that but not to brag I always get an high honor and I also don't have any idea how that thing happen. I'm basically enjoying my highschool life and I'm not really stressing myself out. I really thougt it was a good oppurtunity to bring out my happiness and focus to something that can make me happy,which is gaming. I do like playing games but I'm making sure that I don't missed any of my acads or school works. I also got many friends there and I do think that highschool is one of the most happiest stage of studying throughout the whole years.

	    <div class="course-col">
		<h3>When things changed</h3>
		<p>Generally, a lot of things changed after highshcool. Things are starting to get hard and I'm expecting that it'll be like that so I'm not really surprised about it. But I do feel shivers when I heard the news that there's a virus that <s>kills</s> a lot of people and it was spreading all across the globe. My life has changed because of that news, everyone is anxious and everyone are panicking because we all encountered some horrible event. I was staying at my home because it's not advisable to go outside when it's not important and it ruins my mental health because the amount of pressure it was giving was heavy enough to totally ruin my way of thinking. I used all of those things as part of my own growth and I compose myself and make my whole existence more meaningful and I manage to go through that sht even I have a shtty family.

	<h1>Additional Information About Me</h1>
     <p>Here are some of my additional Information about my life.</p>

     <div class="row1">
     	<div class="infos-col">
     		<h3>Life As Introvert</h3>
     		<p> I'm not really an introvert but due to our societies action they make me wanna live in solitude. Things are getting harder when you always think about what other people think about you and things will also change on your pespective because you'll get affected by it and you'll be the one who needs to change just to avoid the mockery of this society. Being an introvert doesn't make someone less human but it can affects their social skills. I'm having hardtime vocalizing my thoughts but it was all good now but there are still situation that I feel really awkward towards other people. I might label as Ambivert but I don't really like that term because I never been so active in socializing but I can  hold a proper conversation with someone it's just not my thing to entertain a lot of them.</p>
     	</div>
     	<div class="row1">
     	<div class="infos-col">
     		<h3>Religion</h3>
     		<p>It says that I'm catholic because I go to church with my family sometimes but I'm really not that religious. Talking about being religious, it is really a sensetive topic but I'll talk just a little so just to make sure you have a little knowledge about me. I'm an atheist, I have a different perspective in the world of religions and I also conduct a research just to support my idea but I don't have any claims that my idea was real. I jsut have a different perspective than others but I do respect everyones religions because there's no value hating their beliefs, I do respect them.</p>
     	</div>
     	<div class="row1">
     	<div class="infos-col">
     		<h3>Being Inconsistent</h3>
     		<p>I'm the type of person who don't know what I'm gonna do after finishing some task and sometimes forgot to do something important in my life. I'm a good at something as long as I'm knowledgable enough to do that task but due to my own actions I tend to procrastinate and will suddenly feel not doing something.I'm an inconsistent type person but when I get the full idea of that task or if I have the responsiblities in my head then I will force my whole system to finish that task as soon as I can but I'll also put a good output on that task.</p>

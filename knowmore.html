	<h1>CHARLES RHEIN B. MARJALINO</h1>
	<h3>Here are some of the informations about me.</h3>
	<p> I'm Charles Rhein Marjalino and I'm 19 years old and I currently live here in montalban rodriguez rizal along with my dad. I'm studying BSIT(Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) in ICCT. I also graduated senior highschool in ICCT San Mateo Campus at the year 2021. Right now I'm still studying at the ICCT but I'm in the main campus right now which located in Cainta. I'm still taking online classes because I don't think I can handle the face to face right now becayse we're also having financial problems so I chose to study online despite of having this kind of method I'm still capable of learning many things and being able to excel at my academics.</br>I went to Elementary school Unit 1 when I was in grade school and I also graduated get my first ever diploma in that school. I spent my 4 years in Burgos National Highschool and I also graduated from that school.I have a brother and sister so basically I have two more siblings. I'm the eldest and the youngest is my little sister, she's my half sister because my mother had her before with another man though I have no issue about it and I comepletely accept everything and I treat my little sister as my real little sister. I already stated that my parents got seperated and I'm currently living with my grandparents here in Montalban Rizal but I also lived there before when I was in 8th to 9th Grade. I don't why I did that but I just feel like spending my time there and it was enjoyable. When I was in 9th Grade I had a group of friends before and I could say the best circle that I've ever had before, we started to make our team for the game that we're palying that time. After school we'll go to our rendezvous where all of us will gather and we're gonna play league of legends against other section. The first time we played together against other section was totally awful because we keep loosing money but at the same time we're also having fun. Later on, we're keep improving and starting to make our own money by just playing that game. A game where we didn't expect we can earn money and friendship, but it ended when we start to graduate from our junior highschool. I also like to cook something but I didn't include this information on my hobbies because the things that I usually cook are just simple dishes and I don't find any reason why I need to put it there. Therefore I will include that information here, I like to cook for myself and for my family but it was more enjoyable when I cook for myself. I also had a cat before but theyre gone now because my shtty family don't like cats so they throw it away without even telling me about it.I get mad because of that and my hate towards my family is starting to grow because of their shty attitude. I don't particularly hate my family I just hate my  titas because they're the one who keeps ruining my life before and until now and the worst case is... We're all living in the house  that's why I hate being here. I like coffee as well, I just started liking coffee in 2021 because I'm curious on how they make coffee and I started to make my own coffee and I started to like my own coffee so I became obsessed with it. I also don't use too much social media because everytime I'm using it, it drains all my energy plus it's makin me lazy so I'm trying not to get attach on any type of social media</p>

     		<h3>Be Successful</h3>
     		<p>There's a lot of things that I needed to do and being on the top of my life is one of them. What I mean by that is, having a life with consistency is a must have life for me. I like to see myself getting satisfied on my own life despite of having a rough child and teenhood so I'd like to offer myself a wonderful and stable life. Spoiling myself with the taste of success is the the moment that I've really been working on. I'm trying to in that situation and will keep spoiling myself and I will givem myself everything that I never had right now.</p>

     		<h3>Have My Own Business</h3>
     		<p> I like to have my own business where I can please other people with my service while enjoying myself. I like drinking coffee so I come up with the idea of having my own cafe. These are not just ordinary coffee shops because in each coffee shop I will build later there are different themes. In that way I can explore myself and my business and make things more enjoyable in my life. I like coffee and cats so the first theme I like to have is a cat cafe and I will make it happen.</p>

     		<h3>Live A Life Withouth Any Regrets</h3>
     		<p> Things are getting rough in my life but I still want to make it memorable because I want to look back and told myself "I've really came a long way". I want to make sure that I will never regret anything in my life so being the best version of myself right now is my only choice. I have to grow, I need to learn and I need to improve everything so I can live my life to the fullest. I will bring myself into a brillaint spot in order for me to enjoy the life that I will have in the future </p>

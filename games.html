			<h3>VALORANT</h3>
			<p>It was a fun a game and I also enjoyed playing it but the only downside on this game is my aim. I do enjoy playing it but I don't really play a lot of games because I got no time playing it but if I were to rate the game I will give 7/10 because there's a also a lot of toxic people here.</p>

			<h3>LEAGUE OF LEGENDS</h3>
			<p>I'm playing this game since 2017 and I do really enjoy this game even I'm getting a panic attacks sometimes and even I'm stressing myself out I still enjoy playing this game. There's a lot of toxic people here too but I do think that I'm good at this game so I don't really get flamed by my team.</p>

		<div class="facilities-col">

			<h3>MINECRAFT</h3>
			<p>I played this game before on my mobile phone and I was a kid back then and really had no idea about building or making stuff and I ain't creative either but as I grew older I'm starting to play this game. This game is my chill game and I used to play this game with my Gf and we're really enjoy this game even though we always get lost.</p>
